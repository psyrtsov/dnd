This is submodule for GWT project that implements Drag and Drop functionality for CellTree.

Content of the module assumes that it will be attached to the project with package name "app.dnd"

This can be achieved by executing command "git submodule add git@github.com:psyrtsov/dnd.git src/app/dnd"
in the project root directory.
In order to be properly compiled by GWT you'll need to include tag "<source path='dnd'/>" into project's XML descriptor.
